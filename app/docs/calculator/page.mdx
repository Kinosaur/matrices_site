# Matrix Calculator (Coming Soon)

---

This will become an interactive area where you can:

- Enter matrices and see validated shapes.
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication.
- (Future) Compute determinants and inverses for square matrices.

## Planned Features

1. Dynamic inputs that expand / shrink with selected dimensions.
2. Real-time validation (dimension checks, square requirements).
3. Clear step-by-step breakdown of each operation.
4. Export / copy result matrix as LaTeX or plain text.

For now, explore the docs using the navigation on the left. Feedback on desired features is welcome.
