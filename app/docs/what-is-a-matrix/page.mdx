# What is a Matrix?

> A matrix is a **rectangular array of numbers** arranged in rows and columns.

You can picture it like a small spreadsheet: rows go left–to–right, columns go top–to–bottom. Formally we write $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ to mean matrix $A$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns and its entries are real numbers.

## Why we use matrices

Matrices compress structure. Instead of writing a system of linear equations line by line, we collect the coefficients into a matrix. They also represent linear transformations ("functions" that preserve addition and scaling) and appear everywhere: graphics, statistics, networks, optimization, machine learning.

Example system:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x + 2y &= 5\\
3x - y &= 7
\end{aligned}
$$
As an **augmented matrix** (coefficients | constants):
$$
\left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
1 & 2 & 5\\
3 & -1 & 7
\end{array}\right]
$$

## Notation & shape

- Shape: $m\times n$ = $m$ rows by $n$ columns.
- Entry notation: $a_{ij}$ = entry in row $i$, column $j$.
- Row vector: $1\times n$. Column vector: $m\times 1$.
- Scalar: $1\times1$ (just a single number, but we can treat it as a $1\times1$ matrix when convenient).
- Square matrix: $m=n$.

Small example:
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times2}.
$$
Entries: $a_{11}=1, a_{12}=2, a_{21}=3, a_{22}=4$.

## Building an augmented matrix (mini illustration)

Given a system, line up variables $x,y,z$ (or whatever ordering you choose), fill in zero for any missing variable, and place constants to the right of a vertical bar:
$$
2x - 3y + 0z = 4 \;\;\longrightarrow\;\; [\;2\; -3\; 0\mid 4\;].
$$

## Tips & habits

- Always compare shapes before an operation; most mistakes are illegal dimension matches.
- Don’t "pad with zeros" to force an operation—if shapes don’t align, the operation is undefined.
- Keep a consistent variable order when forming matrices from equations.
- Write indices clearly: row first, column second ($a_{ij}$ not $a_{ji}$).
- For small mental checks, test with a $2\times2$ example: if a statement fails there, it’s false in general.

## Quick practice: system to augmented matrix

Convert the system to a single augmented matrix (variables in order $x,y,z$):

1. $3x - y = 1$
2. $4x + 5z = 6$
3. $x + 2y = -1 + 32$
4. $2y - 9 = -5z$

**Normalize each equation (move everything except constants to the left, combine constants):**
1. $3x - 1y + 0z = 1$
2. $4x + 0y + 5z = 6$
3. $x + 2y + 0z = 31$ (because $-1 + 32 = 31$)
4. $0x + 2y + 5z = 9$ (add $5z$ to LHS, add $9$ to RHS)

Coefficients | constants:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
3 & -1 & 0 & 1\\
4 & 0 & 5 & 6\\
1 & 2 & 0 & 31\\
0 & 2 & 5 & 9
\end{array}\right]
$$

**Self‑check prompts:**
- Did every row include a coefficient for each of $x,y,z$ (using 0 where absent)?
- Are constants isolated on the right column?
- Could any row be simplified (e.g., common factor) without changing the solution set? (Not required, just a habit.)

## Remember before moving on

1. Shape notation ($m\times n$) and index order ($a_{ij}$) are foundational.
2. Augmented matrix: coefficients + constants separated by a bar.
3. Never invent entries to force compatibility—choose the right operation instead.

Next up: try **Matrix Addition** (entrywise operation) or jump to **Matrix Multiplication** (row-by-column dot products) once you are comfortable with shapes.
