# What is a Matrix?

---

## Overview

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers (or other objects) arranged in rows and columns. Matrices encode structured data and linear maps; they are written as $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ when $A$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

## Notation and shape

- Shape: $m\times n$ (rows $\times$ columns).
- Entry notation: $a_{ij}$ is the entry in row $i$, column $j$.
- Special cases: a row vector is $1\times n$, a column vector is $m\times 1$, a scalar is $1\times1$, and a square matrix has $m=n$.

## Small example (2×2)

Let

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times2}.
$$

This matrix has entries $a_{11}=1$, $a_{12}=2$, $a_{21}=3$, $a_{22}=4$. It's a convenient size for illustrating operations such as addition (entrywise) and multiplication (row-by-column).

## Why it matters

Matrices are the standard language for linear algebra. They represent systems of linear equations, transformations, datasets, adjacency relations, and more. Many algorithms operate on matrices; keeping track of shape and entry indices is the most important practical habit.

## Quick sanity checks

- Always check shapes before combining matrices: operations are only defined for compatible shapes.
- Do not "pad" matrices with zeros to force compatibility — the operation is undefined unless explicitly specified by a different construction.
