# Matrix Addition

## Overview

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrix addition is one of the simplest matrix operations: you add two matrices by adding their corresponding entries. The operation is defined only when the two matrices have identical dimensions (same number of rows and columns).

## Definition

Let $A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. Their sum $C = A + B$ is defined entrywise:

$$
c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}.
$$

Subtraction: $A - B = A + (-1)B$.

Example (subtraction as addition of a negated matrix):

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}4 & 1 \\\ 0 & 3\end{bmatrix},\qquad
B = \begin{bmatrix}2 & 5 \\\ 7 & 1\end{bmatrix}\quad\Rightarrow\quad
A - B = \begin{bmatrix}4-2 & 1-5 \\\ 0-7 & 3-1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2 & -4 \\\ -7 & 2\end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Procedure

1. Check dimensions: rows$(A)$ = rows$(B)$ and cols$(A)$ = cols$(B)$. If not, stop (undefined).
2. Create a new matrix $C$ with the same dimensions $m\times n$ as $A$ and $B$.
3. For each row $i=1..m$ and column $j=1..n$, compute the entry
   $$c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}.$$
4. Complexity: performing the operation requires $m\cdot n$ scalar additions (one per entry), where $A,B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$.

## Worked Example

Consider these two 2x3 matrices:

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 \\\ 4 & 5 & 6\end{bmatrix},\qquad
B=\begin{bmatrix}7 & 3 & 1 \\\ 5 & 3 & -1\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Both are $2\times3$, so we can add them entrywise. Compute each entry of $C=A+B$:

$$
c_{11}=1+7=8,\quad c_{12}=2+3=5,\quad c_{13}=3+1=4,\\
c_{21}=4+5=9,\quad c_{22}=5+3=8,\quad c_{23}=6+(-1)=5.
$$

Therefore

$$
C = A + B = \begin{bmatrix}8 & 5 & 4 \\\ 9 & 8 & 5\end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Pitfalls

- Mismatched shapes (e.g. $2\times 3$ with $3\times 2$).
- Treating subtraction as separate logic (just add the negated second matrix).

- Attempting to "pad" a smaller matrix with zeros to force dimensions to match (the operation is undefined; do not pad).
- Confusing addition (entrywise / componentwise) with multiplication (row-by-column); they are fundamentally different operations.

Other quick sanity notes:

- Terminology: addition is entrywise (also called componentwise) â€” each output entry is the sum of corresponding inputs.
- Sanity check: if shapes differ, do not try to pad with zeros; instead, reconsider whether a different construction (e.g., block matrices) is intended.

## Summary

Key idea: Addition and subtraction are entrywise and require identical dimensions; they are not related to row-reduction or row-by-column multiplication rules.

## Properties

- Commutative: $A+B = B+A$ (when dimensions match).
- Associative: $(A+B)+C = A+(B+C)$ (when all sums are defined).

## Related operations

- Subtraction: $A-B = A + (-1)B$, computed entrywise; note $A-B \ne B-A$ in general.
- Scalar multiplication: $\alpha A$ multiplies every entry of $A$ by scalar $\alpha$.
